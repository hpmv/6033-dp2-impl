This repository contains a partial implementation of my group's 6.033 Design Project 2.

The code is written in NodeJS.

h4. What is Implemented

* Operational Transformation (edit_seq.js) on INSERT, DELETE, MOVE. The runtime is O(|a||b|) as described in paper.
* Repository operations such as add revision, head advancement, merge, synchronize. (repository.js)
* Networking transmissions. (comm.js, repo_comm.js)

h4. What is Not Implemented

* Two-phase commit.
* Editor queuing during online editing (current implementation just ignores the problem).
* The diff-merge merging strategy. Current implementation only uses OT.
* Dynamic group membership (since two-phase commit isn't implemented anyway).
* User conflict resolution.

h4. What is not tested

* Online editing with more than two users.
* Other stuff are generally poorly tested.

h2. The CLI Client

The implementation includes a CLI client in cli_client.js. The client supports the following commands:

* connect &lt;ip_address&gt; &lt;port&gt; : connects to the specified address and port.
* insert &lt;pos&gt; &lt;text&gt; : inserts text at specified position.
* delete &lt;frompos&gt; &lt;topos&gt; : deletes text from frompos to topos.
* move &lt;frompos&gt; &lt;topos&gt; &lt;targetpos&gt; : moves text from frompos to topos to target pos.
* disconnect : disconnects all neighbouring connections.

Whenever local document is changed, the console prints the updated document.
